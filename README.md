# Welcome

This is a personal page that is hosted at https://gustavfredriksson.com. It's not fancy in any way, it's a basic lasagna with layers of React, CSS and HTML. The only fancy thing about this project is that it's using CI(CircleCI) & CD(Google cloud build). It's rather minimalistic; feel free to fork it and use this as boilerplate for a CRA project with CD built-in(follow [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-firebase) step-by-step and you should be set).
