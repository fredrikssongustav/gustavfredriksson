        Every once in a while we should pause and appreciate what we have. It is
        a clich√© really, but also a good mental exercise to figure out what
        brings actual value to one&apos;s life. With respect to tooling,
        it&apos;s likely to think of your favourite IDE, note carrier or version
        control tooling. All very important, but also equally known for their
        value.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I want to shed light on the obscure tooling, that thing that likely
        started as someone&apos;s backyard project and seldom updates but
        nonetheless keeps on working. For me that tooling is{" "}
        <CleanA href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/">Spectacle</CleanA>.
        Spectacle is minimalistic, it is plug-n-play, never disturbs it&apos;s
        users and has two features: re-locate and re-size windows.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Ever witnessed the near-torture experience of seeing someone screenshare
        and trying to find the re-size corner? Well, that wasn&apos;t me.
        Though, MacOS do provide similar features, but satisfactory enough for
        me, aspiring to be the Gandalf of window re-sizing üßôüèΩ‚Äç.
      </p>,
      <p>Actual footage of me flexing these features:</p>,
