        Every once in a while we should pause and appreciate what we have. It is
        a clich√© really, but also a good mental exercise to figure out what
        brings actual value to one&apos;s life. With respect to tooling,
        it&apos;s likely to think of your favourite IDE, note carrier or version
        control tooling. All very important, but also equally known for their
        value.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I want to shed light on the obscure tooling, that thing that likely
        started as someone&apos;s backyard project and seldom updates but
        nonetheless keeps on working. For me that tooling is{" "}
        <CleanA href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/">Spectacle</CleanA>.
        Spectacle is minimalistic, it is plug-n-play, never disturbs it&apos;s
        users and has two features: re-locate and re-size windows.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Ever witnessed the near-torture experience of seeing someone screenshare
        and trying to find the re-size corner? Well, that wasn&apos;t me.
        Though, MacOS do provide similar features, but satisfactory enough for
        me, aspiring to be the Gandalf of window re-sizing üßôüèΩ‚Äç.

        Okay, Postman is not one of the tools I enjoy working with. But even so,
        I fallback to it when I get tired of pasting bearer tokens into{" "}
        <code>curl</code>. A recent struggle I had, involved grabbing request
        body, constructing a URL from it and then have it open in the browser.
        Feels like a pretty basic task, but it seem Postman does not support
        this(
        <CleanA href="https://community.postman.com/t/using-window-open-in-pre-request-script/9237">
          some postman thread
        </CleanA>
        ,{" "}
        <CleanA href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67105878/can-postman-automatically-open-a-new-browser-window-after-response">
          some stackoverflow post
        </CleanA>
        ,{" "}
        <CleanA href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/2030">
          some Github issue telling the feature exist but is broken
        </CleanA>
        ). I could write a script, but in the future I plan on sharing this
        collection; and arbitrary scripts are tedious to maintain.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So in order to fix this I need three things:
        <ol>
          <li>Something that can take an URL and open it in a browser</li>
          <li>Something in Postman that communicates with the above</li>
          <li>
            Something that let&apos;s me execute a request in Postman and then
            trigger the above
          </li>
        </ol>
        3. is fairly easy and can be setup using the{" "}
        <CleanA href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/">
          Postman test feature
        </CleanA>
        , allowing for writing post-request scripts in JS. 1. is where I took
        the hacky highway, creating a simple node server:
        <CodeBlock>
          {`
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const open = require("open");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const port = 1;
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.get("/open-url", (req, res) => {
  open(req.body.q);
  res.send("Opened url!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(\`Listening at http://localhost:\${port}\`);
});
          `}
        </CodeBlock>
        2. could then we achieved by making a mock API call as a part of a
        Postman collection‚Äìexported as curl it looked like:
        <CodeBlock>
          {`
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:1/open-url' \\
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\
--data-urlencode 'q=https://gustavfredriksson.com'
          `}
        </CodeBlock>
      </p>,

export const Blog = () => {

  const post = blogData.find((p) => p.id === id);
